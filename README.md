Tapir
-----

Tapir is so named because it's one of the few words in /usr/share/dict/words with 'api' in it.  

Tapir is a quick and dirty attempt to make a PHP library that makes speaking to various APIs easy.  It is loosely inspired by https://github.com/bradfeehan/desk-php in that I wanted to interact with the API in the same way, but didn't want to go into the specifics of representing the structure of the data that will be returned.  Essentially tapir lets you name URLs and their substitution patterns.
